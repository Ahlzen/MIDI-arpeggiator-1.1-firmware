Build notes
* Use PlatformIO with "Raspberry Pi Pico" board
* Update platformio with
  platform = https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi.git
  board_build.core = earlephilhower
* Use Zadig to install USB drivers: RPi2 boot interface -> WinUSB
* Had to delete a few broken packages out of C:\Users\{user}\.platformio\packages (auto-reinstalls)

Fix:
o Weird stuck notes in other modes
o Gate not working quite right
o Fix double first-note in up/down mode

Todo:
o Tempo LED
o Enable hold without turning arp on/off (fix button events)
* Remaining LEDs / buttons
* MIDI sync?
* Flash in hold mode
